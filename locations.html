            Located in the heart of Old San Juan, the San Juan Bautista
            Cathedral is a magnificent testament to the rich history and
            architectural splendor of Puerto Rico. This Roman Catholic
            cathedral, built in 1540, has witnessed centuries of love stories,
            which makes it the perfect backdrop for our romantic celebration. As
            you walk through its grand entrance, you'll be transported back in
            time, surrounded by the warm glow of stained glass windows and the
            intricate details of its Baroque facade.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we exchange our vows beneath the cathedral's soaring arches, we
            invite you to share in the beauty and enchantment of this historic
            site. The San Juan Bautista Cathedral offers a unique blend of
            old-world charm and modern elegance that will create an
            unforgettable experience for our wedding ceremony. Join us as we
            begin our journey together in this breathtaking setting, a testament
            to the enduring power of love and the magic of Old San Juan.
